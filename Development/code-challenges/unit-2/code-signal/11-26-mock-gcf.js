// Question 1:
/* 
PEDAC
PROBLEM:
- INPUT: an array of positive integers, and a target number
- OUTPUT: the index of the last integer added that is greater than the target number

EDGE CASES:
- EXAMPLE 1:
visits = [300, 200, 100, 200, 500]
target = 700
    0: 300 < 700
    1: 300 + 200 = 500 < 700
    2: 500 + 100 = 600 < 700
    3: 600 + 200 = 800 > 700
OUTPUT = 3

- EXAMPLE 2:
visits = [900, 821, 1090]
target = 900
    0: 900 = 900
OUTPUT = 0

- EXAMPLE 3:
visits = [700, 800, 500]
target = 2001
    0: 700 < 2001
    1: 700 + 800 = 1500 < 2001
    2: 1500 + 500 = 2000 < 2001
OUTPUT: -1

DATA TYPES:
- for loop / reduce()
- if statement

ALGORITHM:
- iterate through the `visits` array
- check if the first number is equal or less than target
    - make a sum variable, add first index to sum
    - if sum is equal to target, return the index of the number
    - if sum is less than target, add the next number to the sum variable
    - if sum of all numbers in the array is less than target, return -1.

CODE:
*/
const solution = (visits, target) => {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < visits.length; i++) {
        sum += visits[i];
        if (sum >= target) {
            return i;
        };
    };
    return -1;
};

// Array method (ChatGPT):
/*
1. Using reduce():
    - The reduce() method iterates through the visits array, and for each element, it adds the number of visitors for that day to total_visits.
    - The accumulator (acc) starts as -1, which represents that we havenâ€™t found a day that meets the target yet.
    - Inside the reduce callback:
    - We update the total_visits by adding visitsToday (the number of visitors for the current day).
    - If total_visits exceeds or equals the target and the accumulator is still -1, we return the current index (index) because this is the first day the target has been reached.
    - If the target is not met, the accumulator remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next day.
2. Final return: If the target is never met, the accumulator will remain -1, and that will be returned.
*/
const solution = (visits, target) => {
    let total_visits = 0;
    // Use reduce to accumulate visits and find the first day where total >= target
    return visits.reduce((acc, visitsToday, index) => {
        total_visits += visitsToday;
        // If we have reached the target, return the index
        if (total_visits >= target && acc === -1) {
            return index;  // Return the first index where total_visits >= target
        }
        return acc;  // Continue with the current value of acc (index)

- Convert the grade from string to integer and update the student's grades in studentGrades.
- After collecting all grades, calculate the average for each student and keep track of the highest average.
- Return the name of the student with the highest average.

2. Accumulate grades per student.
3. Calculate averages and find the maximum.
